- Developed a **machine learning model** to predict flight ticket prices.
- Performed **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**.
- Trained model using **Scikit-learn**.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Created Jupyter Notebook (`flight_price_prediction.ipynb`) with detailed steps.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
